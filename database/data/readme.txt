This directory, database/data, is specified as the data directory for mysql as Vagrant boots up. Once databases are imported on the initial 'vagrant up' from database/backups, they will persist in Vagrant even after a 'vagrant destroy'.

If you would like to remove one of these databases so that it can be reimported, a 'DROP DATABASE db_name' would need to be run though the mysql command line or external tool.
