# Varying Vagrant Vagrants Changelog

## 0.9-working
* Use `precise32` for the Vagrant box name for better cross project box caching.
    * **Note:** This will probably cause a new Vagrant box to download. Use `vagrant box remove std-precise32` after a `vagrant destroy` to remove the old one and start with this.
* **Possible Breaking:** Remove flags system entirely.
	* **Note:** The only remaining flag was for the WordPress unit tests. The functionality of this flag can be duplicated by creating the empty directory `{vvv_dir}/www/wordpress-unit-tests`.
* **Possible Breaking:** Change VM hostname to `vvv`
    * **Note:** If you had anything setup to rely on the hostname of precise32-dev, this may break.
* Update stable version of WordPress automatically on provision
* Provide default certs for SSL in Nginx
* Update to phpMyAdmin 4.0.5

## 0.8
* Enable SSH agent forwarding
* Wrap update/installation procedures with a network status check
* Enable WP_DEBUG by default
* Update wp-cli during provisioning
* Better handling of package status checks
* Better handling of custom apt sources
* Add PHPMemcachedAdmin 1.2.2 to repository for memcached stats viewing.
* Add phpMyAdmin 4.0.3 to repository for database management

## 0.7

**BREAKING CHANGES**: Breaking changes are made in this release due to the reorganization of config files for PHP that will require a full `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` to resolve.
