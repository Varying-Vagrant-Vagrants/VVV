## 3.2.0 ( 2019 )

### Enhancements

 - Improved output of `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off`
 - Updated the default config to reference PHP 7.4 support
 - webgrind is now provisioned using composer
 - Added support for the vagrant-disksize plugin if available

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed cloning site provisioners into empty directories
 - Enabled MailHog for all PHP versions
 - Removed trailing spaces from all provisioner files and configs
 - `my.cnf` is now readable by the vagrant user
 - Fixes to newline substitution in the splash screen and some rearrangement
 - MySQL binary logging is now disabled

## 3.1.1 ( 2019 August 6th )

This is a quick update that changes a default parameter when undefined. In VVV 2 the database was stored inside the VM, and in VVV 3 we put it in a shared folder. This didn't work for some people, so we added a config option to disable this. If this option wasn't set, VVV would use the shared folder.

In v3.1.1 if the option isn't set, it will instead store the database inside the VM. This makes it work out of the box for everybody. If you have a working VVV with the shared folder, you can restore this behaviour by setting `db_share_type: true` in `vvv-custom.yml` and reprovisioning, see `vvv-config.yml` for an example of where this setting goes

### Enhancements

 - Improved the default `vvv-config.yml` to show new site template parameters
 = VVV installs less out of the box with a simplified `vvv-config.yml`, uncomment utilities to add software back in

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixes the grunt installation
 - Fixes to file permissions in the `/vagrant` folder
 - Removed typos in the readme
 - Switched to a new box for VMWare
 - Shared folder warning fixes for VMWare
 - Trailing whitespace removed from the editorconfig file
 - Visiting the dashboard before it's provisioned now no longer gives a PHP error

## 3.1.0 ( 2019 July 4th )

This is primarily a reliability update. Note that updating to v3.1 requires a `vagrant destroy` and a `vagrant up --provision`. If you've turned off shared database folders, backup beforehand.

### Enhancements

 - The vagrant box can now be overriden using the `box` parameter in `vvv-custom.yml` under the `vm_config` section. This requires a `vagrant destroy` followed by a `vagrant up --provision` to recreate the VM using the new box
 - The main provisioner now only fetches the apt keys once rather than on every key check
 - The TTY fix shell provisioner and the `/vagrant` setup shell provisioner were merged for a minor reduction in provisioning time.
 - Allow `db_backup` script to be run manually regardless if automatic DB backups are disabled
 - `vvv`, `vvv.dev`, and `vvv.local` now redirect to `vvv.test`
 - Added a premade Sequel Pro config file under the `database` folder
 - Set GitHub token from `vvv-custom.yml` for Composer

### Bug Fixes

 - Changed to the `ubuntu/bionic64` box to avoid issues with kernel page cache corruption until they can be identified, these were causing issues when updating a WP installation
 - Fixes to mysql user and group creation to improve shared folder reliability
 - Fixed an issue with permissions in files copied to the home folder
 - Fixed shared folder and permissions for Microsoft Hyper-V
 - Fixed all mount_options to the correct permissions for Microsoft Hyper-V
 - Set VM Name to exactly the same as VirtualBox, using v.vmname for Hyper-V
 - Fixes to log file paths for XDebug and PHP
 - Fixes files and folders in the home folder being owned by root instead of vagrant
 - Fixes support for database names containing hyphens in the import/restore scripts
 - Fixes the site provisioner attempting to clone site templates into existing sites when a site template is added to a site that didn't have one before, but has already provisioned ( it will note that this happened but won't clone the template )
 - Removed some references to Go
 - Fixed symlink issues with apt source files by copying instead
 - Specify `keep_colors` on vagrant provisioners to prevent composer from outputting valid messages in the red error colours, unnecessarily alarming users
 - `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off` now toggle Tideways so that XDebug and Tideways are never running at the same time
 - Switched to Node v10 by default to fix compatibility issues with the WP Core build scripts
 - Runs the npm commands in the main provisioner under the vagrant user
 - Node v11 is now auto-downgraded to Node v10
 - Fixed Database SSH access from the host by enabling password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
 - Added code to remove NVM
 - Change Permission folder `/vagrant` from root to vagrant

## 3.0.0 ( 17 May 2019 )

This version moves to an Ubuntu 18.04 box. It also moves the database data directory to a mounted folder. This means you can destroy and rebuild the VM without loss, but it also means **a `vagrant destroy` is necessary to update**. **Be sure to back up database tables you need beforehand**.

If you have issues provisioning with the new shared database folder, you can disable it by adding `db_share_type: false` to the `general:` section of `vvv-custom.yml` then reprovisioning. This will return you to the VVV 2 behaviour. 

In the near future, we expect to use a box with PHP/etc preinstalled, this will be VVV 4.0.

### Enhancements

 - The box was changed to use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
 - If cloning a git repo to create a new site fails, VVV will halt provisioning and warn the user
 - Added tbe `git-svn` package, `git-svn` is used for bi-directional operation between subversion and git
 - MongoDB was updated to v4.0
 - New `/srv/provision` and `/srv/certificates` shared folders
 - Provisioners now log their output to a `logs/provisioners` folder, with each provision having its own subfolder

### Bug Fixes

 - Added a VVV package mirror PPA
 - Updated apt-get keys for several sources
 - Prevented provisioning from occurring inside Ubuntu 14 VMs
 - Fixed issues with Nginx restarting too fast and too often by reloading instead
 - Fixed the permissions on the `db_restore` script
 - The `/var/log` folder is no longer directly mounted, instead the `/var/log/php`, `/var/log/nginx`, `/var/log/provisioners` and `/var/log/memcached` subfolders are mounted. This improves compatibility
 - The SQL import script for backups will now create the databases if they don't exist before importing

### Removals

 - The deprecated domains `vvv.dev`, `vvv.local`, and `vvv.localhost`, were removed, the dashboard lives at `vvv.test`.
 - Removed the `/vagrant` default shared folder

## 2.6.0 ( 2nd April 2019 )

### Enhancements

 * Auto download plugin for vagrant, supported vagrant 2.2.0+
 * Autoset the locale inside the virtual machine to avoid errors in the console

 * Added a `wordcamp_contributor_day_box` flag to the `vm_config` section of `vvv-config.yml` so that contributor day setup scripts are simpler

### Bug Fixes

 * Improved detection of VirtualBox path to avoid `???` version numbers in the VVV splash

## 2.5.1 ( 14th January 2019 )

2.5 Brings a major bug fix, and some performance improvements to provisioning

### Enhancements

 * Updated PHPMemcachedadmin from v1.2.2.1 to v1.2.3
 * A new `db_backup` option was added to `vvv-custom.yml`
 * A new `db_restore` option was added to skip the initial import

 * Additional warnings and messages were added to aid with debugging site provisioners
 * VVV will warn the user if no hosts are defined for a site, or if no folder exists for a site
 * Skipping provisioning on a site will now make the site provisioner abort earlier
 * Site provisioners no longer need to use nginx template config files to add TLS keys, they can use `{vvv_tls_cert}` and `{vvv_tls_key}` in `vvv-nginx.conf`
 * `tideways.vvv.test` is now registered if the experimental tideways xhgui utility is present

### Deprecations

 * Loading vvv-hosts is now skipped if hosts are defined in the VVV configuration file

### Documentation

Many updates to VVV's documentation were made between the release of 2.0.0 and now. As of 2.1.0, the process to contributing to documentation has changed to use the [varyingvagrantvagrants.org](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org) repository. This allows the workflow for shipping documentation changes to proceed separately from shipping VVV releases.

## 2.0.0 (March 13, 2017)

VVV 2.0.0 introduces **breaking changes** in how files are organized and introduces an entirely new method of configuration.

A full `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` are recommended for best results. Running `vagrant destroy` will remove your virtual machine entirely and all data stored on the VM will be lost. Please be sure to backup your databases and any files stored in the VM. Files on your local file system will remain, but will still benefit (as always) from a backup.

It is possible to make the from VVV 1.4.x to 2.0.0 without a `vagrant destroy`, but the process will involve restructuring several things. Primarily, default project directories are now expected to contain a `public_html/` directory. This requires not only file changes, but new Nginx configurations. If you need help troubleshooting, don't hesitate to open a new issue.

Please see the [migration documentation](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/migrating-from-vvv-1-4-x/) for tips on how to manage this process.

The decision to include breaking changes in a release is not made lightly. The new ability to configure your installation of VVV with a `vvv-custom.yml` file will make VVV entirely more flexible and maintainable than it has ever been. Please see the [release blog post](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2017/03/13/varying-vagrant-vagrants-2-0-0.html) and [documentation](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/) for more details.

### Features & Enhancements

* Introduce a YAML configuration for VVV. It is now possible to customize your configuration of VVV with a `vvv-custom.yml` file that defines which projects, hosts, and utilities are provisioned. See [#980](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/980).
* Introduce a new [VVV Utilities repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities). This works with the new YAML configuration to provide the ability to customize what utilities are provisioned with VVV. See [#1021](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1021).
* Introduce a new [VVV Custom Site Template repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template). This can be used in `vvv-custom.yml` to quickly add new sites to VVV.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Develop repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop). This is used in the default `vvv-config.yml` and can be used in (or excluded from) custom configurations.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Default repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default). This is used in the default `vvv-config.yml` and can be used in (or excluded from) custom configurations.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Trunk repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-trunk). This can be used in custom configurations if you'd like a checkout of WordPress trunk.
* Add support for custom keys in the YAML configuration. These are available to individual site provisioning scripts. See [#1071](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1071).
* Add support for PHP 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1 via the VVV YAML configuration. See [#1055](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1055).
* Introduce a new documentation structure and an entire set of new documentation. See [#1073](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1073) and, more importantly, [#1112](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1112).
* Introduce documentation explaining the governance of VVV. See [#1118](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1118).
* Install MariaDB 10.1 instead of MySQL 5.5 as part of default provisioning. See [#1005](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1005) and [#1115](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1115).
* Install and update WP-CLI with its PHAR file rather than with a git clone. See [#1057](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1057).
* Add the `php-memcached` package to default provisioning as an alternative to `php-memcache` that works with PHP 7.0. See [#1076](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1076).
* Set `colordiff` as the default `svn diff` command tool. See [#1077](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1077).
* Add a VVV logo to provisioning. See [#1110](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1110).
* Add some style to the default VVV dashboard. See [#1122](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1122).

### Bugs

* Remove old, unused `mu-plugins` directory. See [#1027](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1027).
* Follow redirects when detecting a network connection. See [#1048](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1048).
* Include `$is_args` with `try_files` in Nginx configuration. See [#1075](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1075).
* Remove an attempt to enforce `ipv4` in Postfix as it was not working. See [#1116](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1116).

## 1.4.1 (January 16, 2017)

* Introduce a documentation structure for future releases.

## 1.4.0 (November 2, 2016)

* Update PHPUnit to the latest stable 5.6.x version. See [#1004](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1004)
* Xdebug 2.4.0 is now built from source to provide PHP 7.0.x support. See [#869](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/869).
* Disable Xdebug during provisioning so that Composer can operate at normal speed. See [#971](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/971)
* Improve the package installation check to avoid false positives. See [#840](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/840).
* Allow `vvv-nginx.conf` to be located in a project's subdirectory. See [#852](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/852).
* Install the latest version of git via its PPA. See [#872](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/872)
* Assign names to pre, custom, default, and post provisioners to make `--provision-with` possible. See [#806](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/806)
* Install `nvm` to provide access to multiple NodeJS versions. See [#863](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/863)
* Provide the NodeJS 6.x LTS release by default. See [#1007](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1007)
* Switch to NodeSource for NodeJS packages. See [#779](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/779)
* Move `query_cache_*` config for MySQL to its proper place in the `[mysqld]` section. See [#925](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/925)
* Allow WordPress core unit test database configuration to be supplied with environment variables. See [#846](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/846).
* Use the correct command `wp core update` when updating WordPress with WP-CLI. See [#958](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/958)
* Remove the `core.svn.wordpress.org` WordPress trunk checkout from default provisioning. `develop.svn.wordpress.org` remains. See [#921](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/921)
* Checkout and initialize the `develop.svn.wordpress.org` repository in a temporary (non-shared) directory. This addresses issues with a possible race condition during NPM package installation on a shared drive. See [#969](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/969)

* PHPUnit: Allow PHPUnit to run tests from the local machine while using the WordPress unit tests database in the virtual machine. See [#785](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/785).
* PHPUnit: Set the `WP_CORE_DIR` path so PHPUnit tests are run against WordPress trunk. See [#783](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/783).
* Provision: Rewrite `provision.sh` to be more modular. This improves readability and may one day aid in testability. See [#659](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/659).

* WordPress: SVN repositories configured in VVV provisioning are now set to HTTPS. Existing repositories configured to HTTP will not automatically update during provisioning unless they are first relocated to HTTPS. The `svn relocate` command can be used for this. See [#561](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/561).
* WP-CLI: Add an external configuration for WP-CLI so that a locally installed copy can be used outside of the VM. See [#564](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/564).

## 1.2.0 (December 14, 2014)
* VVV is now [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/LICENSE).
* ***Possible Breaking:*** By default, database files are no longer mapped to a local location.
	* A full `vagrant destroy` and the removal of MySQL data from `{vvv-dir}/database/data/` is recommended.
	* If database files already exist from an earlier version of VVV, data will continue to be mapped locally until removed.
	* Database data will continue to exist on the virtual machine through `vagrant halt` and `vagrant suspend`.
	* Database data will no longer exist on the virtual machine after `vagrant destroy`.
	* A `db_backup` script is provided by default that creates local backups of each database on halt, suspend, and destroy if the vagrant-triggers plugin is installed.
* ***Possible Breaking:*** Ubuntu has been upgraded from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. We have also moved from 32bit to 64bit.
	* A full `vagrant destroy` is recommended for best results.
	* A new box will be downloaded for the base virtual machine. If you'd like to free space, remove the old box with `vagrant box remove precise32`. Running `vagrant box list` will show you all base VMs on your local machine.
	* With a new operating system comes a new RSA key. If you are connecting via SSH through an application that relies on your machines `known_hosts` file, you will need to clear the old key for 192.168.50.4. [See #365](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/365)
* Init scripts are now fired with `source` rather than `bash`. Due to this change, something like `cd "$(dirname $0)"` no longer works as expected. See [#373](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/373) and [#370](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/370) for reasoning and discussion.
* WordPress: Add `develop_git` to convert the default SVN checkout to Git.
* PHP: Update to PHP 5.5.x
* PHP: Remove php-apc and apc.ini. Enable built in opcache.
* PHP: Start tracking custom php5-fpm.conf file.
* PHP: Start tracking custom opcache.ini file.
* PHP: Update to PHPUnit 4.0.x
* PHP: Install XDebug PECL extension directly, rather than via apt.
* phpMyAdmin: Update to 4.2.13.1
* WP-Cli: Add support for autocomplete.
* VVV Dashboard: Add [Opcache Status](https://github.com/rlerdorf/opcache-status) for opcache monitoring.
* Bash: Allow for a custom `bash_prompt` file in `config/`
* NodeJS: Use recommended PPAs to install
* NodeJS: Self update NPM during provisioning
* Logs: Map a shared directory for logs, start storing `php_errors.log`
* Nginx: Install using the mainline repository, currently 1.7.x.

## 1.1
* Transition to [Varying Vagrant Vagrants organization](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants).
* Add a CONTRIBUTING document.
* Add `--allow-root` to all `wp-cli` calls in VVV core.
* Use a new global composer configuration.
* Add `zip` as a package during provisioning.
* Introduce a helpful caveats section.
* Remove `tcp_nodelay` config in Nginx. Reasoning in 0cce79501.

## 1.0
* **Introduce** [Auto Site Setup](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/VVV/wiki/Auto-site-Setup) during provisioning to allow for easy new project configuration.
* **Happy Fix** `vagrant up` after halt meets expectations and no longer requires provisioning to be reapplied.
* Begin implementing best practices from Google's [shell style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml) in our provisioning scripts.
* Databases can now be dropped in phpMyAdmin. Pro-tip, `drop database wordpress_develop` in phpMyAdmin followed by `vagrant provision` clears your src.wordpress-develop.dev for reinstall.
* Copy config files instead of linking them. This allows for a nicer `vagrant up` after a `vagrant halt` and treats provisioning more like it should be treated. See [1fbf329](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/VVV/commit/1fbf32926e69b852d912047da1bfa7c302693b82) for a more detailed commit message.
* Allow for `dashboard-custom.php` to override the default dashboard provided by VVV
* Reduce size of the included `my.cnf` file to exclude unrequired changes. Increase `max_allowed_packet` setting.

## 0.9
* **Possible Annoying:** Use `precise32` for the Vagrant box name for better cross project box caching.
    * **Note:** This will probably cause a new Vagrant box to download. Use `vagrant box remove std-precise32` after a `vagrant destroy` to remove the old one and start with this.
* **Possible Breaking:** Change VM hostname to `vvv.dev`
    * **Note:** If you had anything setup to rely on the hostname of precise32-dev, this may break.
* **Possible Breaking:** Change MySQL root password to `root`
	* **Note:** If anything is setup to rely on the previous password of `blank`, this  may break.
	* You can also now access `mysql -u root` without a password.
* **Introduce** support for the WordPress develop.svn
	* This was added pretty much the day it was available. Such a pleasure to work with!
	* Allowed us to remove the old `wordpress-unit-tests` in favor of the new `wordpress-develop/tests`
* **Introduce** support for the Vagrant hostsupdater plugin
	* Use `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater` to install.
	* Very, very much recommended for an easier and happier life.
* **Introduce** Postfix with a default config. Mail works! (But check your spam)
* **Introduce** the WordPress i18n Tools, including `config/homebin/makepot`
* **Introduce** PHP_CodeSniffer, WordPress-Coding-Standards, and Webgrind
* **Remove** entire well intended but not so useful flags system
* Rather than include PHPMemcachedadmin in the VVV repository, download it on initial provision
* Verify support for Vagrant 1.3.5 (as well as 1.2.x) and VirtualBox 4.3 (as well as 4.2.x)
* Move `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off` controls to executable files in `config/homebin`
* Generate `vagrant_dir` in `Vagrantfile` for accessing relative file locations
* Add a basic network connectivity check by pinging Google DNS servers
* Update stable version of WordPress automatically on provision
* General cleanup to screen output during provisioning
* Many updates to the default nginx configuration
* Remove poor, unused implementation of Watchr
* Provide default certs for SSL in Nginx

## 0.8
* Enable SSH agent forwarding
* Wrap update/installation procedures with a network status check
* Enable WP_DEBUG by default
* Update wp-cli during provisioning
* Better handling of package status checks
* Better handling of custom apt sources
* Add PHPMemcachedAdmin 1.2.2 to repository for memcached stats viewing.
* Add phpMyAdmin 4.0.3 to repository for database management

## 0.7

**BREAKING CHANGES**: Breaking changes are made in this release due to the reorganization of config files for PHP that will require a full `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` to resolve.
