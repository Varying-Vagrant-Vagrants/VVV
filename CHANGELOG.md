### Bug fixes and enhancements
* Composer: Set a custom GitHub token for Composer if it exists. See [#575](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/575).
* Docs: Update inline `Vagrantfile` documentation to better explain various network configurations.
* MySQL: Enable `innodb_file_per_table`. See [#537](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/537).
* npm: Add `npm-check-updates` during provisioning to help manage `package.json` inside the VM. See [#484](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/484).
* PHP: Bump max upload size in PHP and Nginx to 1024MB to support developing on the Internet in the year 2016. See [#599](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/599).
* PHPCS: Set default code standards for PHPCS to WordPress-Core. See [#574](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/574).
* phpMyAdmin: Allow for a custom phpMyAdmin configuration file. See [#688](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/688).
* PHPUnit: Update PHPUnit to 4.3.8. A future update of VVV should include PHP 5.6.x or PHP 7 and allow us to update PHPUnit to 5.x. See [#808](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/808).
* PHPUnit: Allow PHPUnit to run tests from the local machine while using the WordPress unit tests database in the virtual machine. See [#785](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/785).
* PHPUnit: Set the `WP_CORE_DIR` path so PHPUnit tests are run against WordPress trunk. See [#783](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/783).
* Provision: Rewrite `provision.sh` to be more modular. This improves readability and may one day aid in testability. See [#659](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/659).
* Vagrant: Set the default box name to that of the working directory to allow for multiple instances of VVV without conflict. See [#706](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/706).
* Vagrant: Allow for a custom trigger, `vagrant_up` to fire during `vagrant up` and `vagrant reload`. See [#778](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/778).
* Vagrant: Make it easier and more forward-compatible to modify the virtual machine's IP address. See [#781](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/781).
* Vagrant: Clarify default setting of 1 CPU when creating the virtual machine. See [#625](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/625/).
* WordPress: Provide better support for testing with xip.io by accounting for these requests in `wp-config.php`. See [#559](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/559).
* WordPress: SVN repositories configured in VVV provisioning are now set to HTTPS. Existing repositories configured to HTTP will not automatically update during provisioning unless they are first relocated to HTTPS. The `svn relocate` command can be used for this. See [#561](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/561).
* WP-CLI: Add an external configuration for WP-CLI so that a locally installed copy can be used outside of the VM. See [#564](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/564).

## 1.2.0 (December 14, 2014)
* VVV is now [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/LICENSE).
* ***Possible Breaking:*** By default, database files are no longer mapped to a local location.
	* A full `vagrant destroy` and the removal of MySQL data from `{vvv-dir}/database/data/` is recommended.
	* If database files already exist from an earlier version of VVV, data will continue to be mapped locally until removed.
	* Database data will continue to exist on the virtual machine through `vagrant halt` and `vagrant suspend`.
	* Database data will no longer exist on the virtual machine after `vagrant destroy`.
	* A `db_backup` script is provided by default that creates local backups of each database on halt, suspend, and destroy if the vagrant-triggers plugin is installed.
* ***Possible Breaking:*** Ubuntu has been upgraded from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. We have also moved from 32bit to 64bit.
	* A full `vagrant destroy` is recommended for best results.
	* A new box will be downloaded for the base virtual machine. If you'd like to free space, remove the old box with `vagrant box remove precise32`. Running `vagrant box list` will show you all base VMs on your local machine.
	* With a new operating system comes a new RSA key. If you are connecting via SSH through an application that relies on your machines `known_hosts` file, you will need to clear the old key for 192.168.50.4. [See #365](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/365)
* Init scripts are now fired with `source` rather than `bash`. Due to this change, something like `cd "$(dirname $0)"` no longer works as expected. See [#373](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/373) and [#370](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/370) for reasoning and discussion.
* WordPress: Add `develop_git` to convert the default SVN checkout to Git.
* PHP: Update to PHP 5.5.x
* PHP: Remove php-apc and apc.ini. Enable built in opcache.
* PHP: Start tracking custom php5-fpm.conf file.
* PHP: Start tracking custom opcache.ini file.
* PHP: Update to PHPUnit 4.0.x
* PHP: Install XDebug PECL extension directly, rather than via apt.
* phpMyAdmin: Update to 4.2.13.1
* WP-Cli: Add support for autocomplete.
* VVV Dashboard: Add [Opcache Status](https://github.com/rlerdorf/opcache-status) for opcache monitoring.
* Bash: Allow for a custom `bash_prompt` file in `config/`
* NodeJS: Use recommended PPAs to install
* NodeJS: Self update NPM during provisioning
* Logs: Map a shared directory for logs, start storing `php_errors.log`
* Nginx: Install using the mainline repository, currently 1.7.x.

## 1.1
* Transition to [Varying Vagrant Vagrants organization](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants).
* Add a CONTRIBUTING document.
* Add `--allow-root` to all `wp-cli` calls in VVV core.
* Use a new global composer configuration.
* Add `zip` as a package during provisioning.
* Introduce a helpful caveats section.
* Remove `tcp_nodelay` config in Nginx. Reasoning in 0cce79501.

## 1.0
* **Introduce** [Auto Site Setup](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/VVV/wiki/Auto-site-Setup) during provisioning to allow for easy new project configuration.
* **Happy Fix** `vagrant up` after halt meets expectations and no longer requires provisioning to be reapplied.
* Begin implementing best practices from Google's [shell style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml) in our provisioning scripts.
* Databases can now be dropped in phpMyAdmin. Pro-tip, `drop database wordpress_develop` in phpMyAdmin followed by `vagrant provision` clears your src.wordpress-develop.dev for reinstall.
* Copy config files instead of linking them. This allows for a nicer `vagrant up` after a `vagrant halt` and treats provisioning more like it should be treated. See [1fbf329](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/VVV/commit/1fbf32926e69b852d912047da1bfa7c302693b82) for a more detailed commit message.
* Allow for `dashboard-custom.php` to override the default dashboard provided by VVV
* Reduce size of the included `my.cnf` file to exclude unrequired changes. Increase `max_allowed_packet` setting.

## 0.9
* **Possible Annoying:** Use `precise32` for the Vagrant box name for better cross project box caching.
    * **Note:** This will probably cause a new Vagrant box to download. Use `vagrant box remove std-precise32` after a `vagrant destroy` to remove the old one and start with this.
* **Possible Breaking:** Change VM hostname to `vvv.dev`
    * **Note:** If you had anything setup to rely on the hostname of precise32-dev, this may break.
* **Possible Breaking:** Change MySQL root password to `root`
	* **Note:** If anything is setup to rely on the previous password of `blank`, this  may break.
	* You can also now access `mysql -u root` without a password.
* **Introduce** support for the WordPress develop.svn
	* This was added pretty much the day it was available. Such a pleasure to work with!
	* Allowed us to remove the old `wordpress-unit-tests` in favor of the new `wordpress-develop/tests`
* **Introduce** support for the Vagrant hostsupdater plugin
	* Use `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater` to install.
	* Very, very much recommended for an easier and happier life.
* **Introduce** Postfix with a default config. Mail works! (But check your spam)
* **Introduce** the WordPress i18n Tools, including `config/homebin/makepot`
* **Introduce** PHP_CodeSniffer, WordPress-Coding-Standards, and Webgrind
* **Remove** entire well intended but not so useful flags system
* Rather than include PHPMemcachedadmin in the VVV repository, download it on initial provision
* Verify support for Vagrant 1.3.5 (as well as 1.2.x) and VirtualBox 4.3 (as well as 4.2.x)
* Move `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off` controls to executable files in `config/homebin`
* Generate `vagrant_dir` in `Vagrantfile` for accessing relative file locations
* Add a basic network connectivity check by pinging Google DNS servers
* Update stable version of WordPress automatically on provision
* General cleanup to screen output during provisioning
* Many updates to the default nginx configuration
* Remove poor, unused implementation of Watchr
* Provide default certs for SSL in Nginx

## 0.8
* Enable SSH agent forwarding
* Wrap update/installation procedures with a network status check
* Enable WP_DEBUG by default
* Update wp-cli during provisioning
* Better handling of package status checks
* Better handling of custom apt sources
* Add PHPMemcachedAdmin 1.2.2 to repository for memcached stats viewing.
* Add phpMyAdmin 4.0.3 to repository for database management

## 0.7
