# This file is a YAML formatted file. YAML indenting is done in spaces not
# tabs, and whitespace is significant. If you don't stick to this, it will
# fail on provision

#
# IMPORTANT, if you change this file, you have to reprovision,  no exceptions
# Do this by running either this command:
# vagrant reload --provision
# 
# Or, if your machine is already turned on:
# vagrant provision
#

# These are your websites, and their names map on to the folders they're

# vm_config controls how Vagrant provisions the virtual machine, and can be used to
# increase the memory given to VVV and the number of CPU cores. For WP core development
# we recommend at least 2GB ( 2048 )
# It can also be used to override the default provider being used within Vagrant.
# Due to a limitation within Vagrant, the specified provider is only respected on a clean `vagrant up`
# as Vagrant currently restricts you to one provider per machine

vm_config:
  memory: 2048
