VVV is a local developer environment, mainly aimed at [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) developers. It uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and VirtualBox/Parallels/HyperV to create a linux server environment for building sites, and contributing to WordPress itself.

_VVV stands for Varying Vagrant Vagrants._
