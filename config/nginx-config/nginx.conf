# This is *the* config file for nginx in the virtual machine, and it

# setup. If you do find yourself altering something here, you may want
# to consider discussing it at the repo so we can share in your findings

    # that create syntax errors and weird encoding issues in CSS that make it seem
    # like your file has been cached forever. Crazy stuff - so off it is.
