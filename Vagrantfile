  # Drive mapping
  #
  # The following config.vm.share_folder settings will map directories in your Vagrant
  # virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
  # changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file.

  # /srv/database/
  #
  # If a database directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile,
  # a mapped directory inside the VM will be created that contains these files.
  # This directory is used to maintain default database scripts as well as backed
  # up mysql dumps (SQL files) that are to be imported automatically on vagrant up
  config.vm.synced_folder "database/", "/srv/database"
  config.vm.synced_folder "database/data/", "/var/lib/mysql", :extra => 'dmode=777,fmode=777'

  # /srv/config/
  #
  # If a server-conf directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile,
  # a mapped directory inside the VM will be created that contains these files.
  # This directory is currently used to maintain various config files for php and 
  # nginx as well as any pre-existing database files.
  config.vm.synced_folder "config/", "/srv/config"
  
  # /srv/config/nginx-config/sites/
  #
  # If a sites directory exists inside the above server-conf directory, it will be
  # added as a mapped directory inside the VM as well. This is used to maintain specific
  # site configuration files for nginx
  config.vm.synced_folder "config/nginx-config/sites/", "/etc/nginx/custom-sites"
  
  # /srv/www/
  #
  # If a www directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile, a mapped directory
  # inside the VM will be created that acts as the default location for nginx sites. Put all
  # of your project files here that you want to access through the web server
  config.vm.synced_folder "www/", "/srv/www/", :owner => "www-data"

  # Customfile - POSSIBLY UNSTABLE
  #
  # Use this to insert your own (and possibly rewrite) Vagrant config lines. Helpful
  # for mapping additional drives. If a file 'Customfile' exists in the same directory
  # as this Vagrantfile, it will be evaluated as ruby inline as it loads. 
  # 
  # Note that if you find yourself using a Customfile for anything crazy or specifying 
  # different provisioning, then you may want to consider a new Vagrantfile entirely.

    eval(IO.read('Customfile'), binding)
