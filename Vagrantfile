  # other devices, a public network should be configured or port forwarding enabled.
  #
  # Note: If your existing network is using the 192.168.50.x subnet, this default IP address
  # should be changed. If more than one VM is running through VirtualBox, including other

  # and forwards any requests to port 8080 on the local host machine to port 80 in the guest.
  #
  # Port forwarding is a first step to allowing access to outside networks, though additional
  # configuration will likely be necessary on our host machine or router so that outside

  # Drive mapping

  # virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
  # changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
  # virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
  # environment.

  # is now available inside the virtual machine to backup all databases for future use. This
  # command is automatically issued on halt, suspend, and destroy if the vagrant-triggers
