# This file contains a list of the domains supported by default
# in Varying Vagrant Vagrants. Both Vagrantfile and provision.sh
# parse this file for domains to add to both your host and guest
# machines as the virtual machines boot.
#
# In addition to this file, other files named vvv-hosts can
# be created with additional domain information. These will be
# automatically parsed as long as they are located in subdirectories
# of the www/ directory.
